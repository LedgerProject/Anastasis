.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The configuration file is line\-oriented.
Blank lines and whitespace at the beginning and end of a line are ignored.
Comments start with \fB#\fP or \fB%\fP in the first column
(after any beginning\-of\-line whitespace) and go to the end of the line.
.sp
The file is split into sections.
Every section begins with “[SECTIONNAME]” and
contains a number of options of the form “OPTION=VALUE”.
There may be whitespace around the \fB=\fP (equal sign).
Section names and options are \fIcase\-insensitive\fP\&.
.sp
The values, however, are \fIcase\-sensitive\fP\&.
In particular, boolean values are one of \fBYES\fP or \fBNO\fP\&.
Values can include whitespace by surrounding
the entire value with \fB"\fP (double quote).
Note, however, that there are no escape characters in such strings;
all characters between the double quotes (including other double quotes)
are taken verbatim.
.sp
Values that represent filenames can begin with a \fB/bin/sh\fP\-like
variable reference.
This can be simple, such as \fB$TMPDIR/foo\fP, or complex,
such as \fB${TMPDIR:\-${TMP:\-/tmp}}/foo\fP\&.
See \fB[PATHS]\fP (below).
.sp
Values that represent a time duration are represented as a series of one or
more \fBNUMBER UNIT\fP pairs, e.g. \fB60 s\fP, \fB4 weeks 1 day\fP, \fB5 years 2 minutes\fP\&.
.sp
Values that represent an amount are in the usual amount syntax:
\fBCURRENCY:VALUE.FRACTION\fP, e.g. \fBEUR:1.50\fP\&.
The \fBFRACTION\fP portion may extend up to 8 places.
.sp
Files containing default values for many of the options described below
are installed under \fB$ANASTASIS_PREFIX/share/taler/config.d/\fP\&.
The configuration file given with \fB\-c\fP to Anastasis binaries
overrides these defaults.
.sp
A configuration file may include another, by using the \fB@INLINE@\fP directive,
for example, in \fBmain.conf\fP, you could write \fB@INLINE@ sub.conf\fP to
include the entirety of \fBsub.conf\fP at that point in \fBmain.conf\fP\&.
\&.. TODO: Document ‘anastasis\-config \-V’ in light of ‘@INLINE@’ in taler\-config(1).
