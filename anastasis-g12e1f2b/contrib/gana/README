            GNUnet Assigned Numbers Authority (GANA)
            ========================================


This Git repository contains various registries we maintain, for
GNUnet other projects that need names and numbers for use in network
protocols.  If you need to open a new registry, please feel free
to contact us at gana@gnunet.org.


History

Barry Leiba wrote on April 4th 2020 that "Neither IANA nor
participants in the IETF will have any necessary expertise to evaluate
registration requests in the sort of registry described, and no one
will be well served by the creation of such a registry at IANA.  It
would be far better to have a registration process be described in
this document involving experts from the industry as reviewers and
maintenance of the registrations by an industry organization, rather
than by IANA."

So here we are. As IETF/IANA "lack the necessary expertise to operate
a registry" for names and numbers used in network protocols, the
GNUnet project is happy to step up.

Design
======

Each registry must have a unique name and all associated information
lives in a directory under that unique name in this Git repository.

Each registry must include at least the following files:

* README[.*]:
    document describing the purpose of the registry in English
* POLICY[.*]:
    registration policy, explaining required fields and
    the procedure for adding, updating and deleting entries
* registry.rec:
    GNU recutils data file with all of the current entries in
    the registry
* Makefile:
    GNU make makefile with a 'make check' target to run the validation logic.
    Ideally, the registry.rec should be written such that the 'check' target
    is simply invoking "recfix --check registry.rec".
    Additional targets to convert data.rec to various formats may be defined.
