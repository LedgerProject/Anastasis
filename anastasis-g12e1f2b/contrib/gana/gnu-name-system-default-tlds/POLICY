Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Key" of the
authoritative zone of a TLD, the "Name" of the TLDS, an optional
"Contact", and a "Reference" with links to further information about the
authority.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive UTF-8 string without dots.

Adding records is possible after expert review by the maintainers of
GNUnet who will define appropriate bribes on a case-by-case basis.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gns-registry@gnunet.org.
