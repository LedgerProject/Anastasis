Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Number" of the
record type, which must be above 65535 (to avoid conflicts with legacy
DNS record types), the "Name" of the record type, and a "Reference" with links
to further information about the record type.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive ASCII string and is restricted to alphanumeric
characters.

Adding records is possible after expert review, using a
first-come-first-served policy for unique "Name" allocation.
Experts are responsible to ensure that the chosen "Name" is
appropriate for the record type.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gns-registry@gnunet.org.
