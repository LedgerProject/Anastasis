This registry is for GNU Name System Record Types.

GNU Name System Record types uniquely identify the different kinds
of key-value pairs that can be in a GNU Name System record set.

This registry is used to ensure that the names and numeric values
used to identify record types are uniquely defined and to
allow GNS resolvers implementors to find out details about the
respective semantics and human-readable syntax.
