GNUnet signature purpose registry.

Every time a signature is created or verified with libgnunetutil's
signature functions, the signer must provide a "purpose" that provides
the context for the signature.  By signing over the "purpose", it is
not possible for an adversary to use a signature made in one context
in another context.
