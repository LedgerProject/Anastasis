# Payto Payment Target Type for LDAP addressing

## Target Type "ldap"

Name: ldap

Description:  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

  The path consists of two components: The routing server and the
  Distinguished Name.

  This is used for transfers within the SWIFT network or likewise
  networks. Limitations on the length and character set of option
  values are defined by the implementation of the handler. Language
  tagging and internationalization of options are not supported.

  The client MAY choose a different connection method than ldap for
  passing the request to the routing server. If no routing server is
  explicitly referenced, the request is routed to a server of the
  client's choice.


Syntax:

     payto-ldap-URI = "payto://ldap/" [host] "/" dn [ "?" opts ]

  'host' is defined in
  [Section 5 of RFC 1738](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738#section-5).

  'dn' is an LDAP Distinguished Name using the string format
  described in
  [Section 3 of RFC 2253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253#section-3)

  'opts' is defined in
  [Section 2 of RFC 8905](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8905#section-2).


Examples:

      payto://ldap//cn=enitest,o=saaabebb,o=swift
      payto://ldap//cn=the-nichname?amount=EUR:50
      payto://ldap/ldap.swift.com/cn=mx01,o=pqvbusda,o=swift


Motivation - not normative

Thy syntax is modeled after the LDAP URL Format
[RFC 2255](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2255).

SWIFT uses several addressing methods in the message formats they define:
* Business Identifier Code (BIC), which is already defined in RFC 8905,
* Distinguished Name (DN) and
* Nickname - which can be an arbitrary string.
