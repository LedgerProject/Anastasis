<h1>Privacy Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Last Updated: 07.09.2021</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Anastasis
SARL (“we,” “our,” or “us”) pertaining to the collection, use, and
disclosure of your information on our sites and related mobile
applications and products we offer (the “Services”). This Privacy
Statement applies to your personal data when you use our Services, and
does not apply to online websites or services that we do not own or
control.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. We follow a few fundamental
principles: We don’t ask you for personally identifiable information
(defined below). That being said, your contact information, such as
your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on
how you contact us), may be collected when you communicate with us,
for example to report a bug or other error related to Anastasis. We
don’t share your information with third parties except when strictly
required to deliver you our Services and products, or to comply with
the law. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy,
please reach out to us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:privacy&#37;&#52;&#48;anastasis&#46;lu">privacy<span>&#64;</span>anastasis<span>&#46;</span>lu</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-you-accept-this-policy">
<h2>How you accept this policy<a class="headerlink" href="#how-you-accept-this-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By using our Services or visiting our sites, you agree to the use, disclosure,
and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-personal-information-do-we-collect-from-our-users">
<h2>What personal information do we collect from our users?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-personal-information-do-we-collect-from-our-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally
identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an
individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable
information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are)
(“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and
will tell you how we might collect and use each type.</p>
<p>We do our best to not collect any Personal Information from Anastasis
users.  The detailed Personal Information Anastasis asks from you during
the regular backup and recovery process at the beginning is never shared
with us and only used to create a cryptographic account identifier which
does not allow us to recover any of your details.</p>
<p>That being said, when using our Services to recover key material, we may
inherently receive the following information (depending on your choice of
authentication method):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bank account details necessary when receiving funds from you to authenticate via a SEPA transfer. We will store these as part of our business records for accounting, and our bank will also be legally obliged to store the details for many years.</p></li>
<li><p>Your phone number when using SMS authentication. We rely on third party providers (such as your mobile network operator) to deliver the SMS to you. These third parties will see the SMS message sent to you and could thus learn that you are using Anastasis. SMS is inherently insecure, and you should expect many governments and private parties to be able to observe these messages.  However, we do not store your SMS number on our systems, except maybe in short-term logs to diagnose errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Your e-mail address when using E-mail authentication. We rely on the Internet and your E-mail provider to deliver the E-mail to you. Internet service providers will see the E-mail message sent to you and could thus learn that you are using Anastasis. E-mail is inherently insecure, and you should expect many governments and private parties to be able to observe these messages.  However, we do not store your E-mail address on our systems, except maybe in short-term logs to diagnose errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Your physical address when using postal mail authentication. We rely on external providers for printing and sending the letter to you. These providers will need to learn your address and could learn that you are using Anastasis. Physical mail has strict privacy protections by law, but governments are known to break postal secrecy. We do not store your physical address on our systems, except maybe in short-term logs to diagnose errors.</p></li>
<li><p>When you contact us. We may collect certain information if you choose to contact us, for example to report a bug or other error with the Taler Wallet. This may include contact information such as your name, email address or phone number depending on the method you choose to contact us.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We primarily use the limited information we receive directly from you to

<p>We reserve the right to update and revise this privacy policy at any time. We
occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with
applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update
this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do
revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top
of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit. As
we generally do not collect contact information and also do not track your
visits, we will not be able to notify you directly. However, Anastasis clients
may inform you about a change in the privacy policy once they detect that the
policy has changed. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that
you are aware of its terms. Any use of our Services after an amendment to our
