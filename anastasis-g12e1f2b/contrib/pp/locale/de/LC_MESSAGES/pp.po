"Your privacy is important to us. We follow a few fundamental principles: "
"We don’t ask you for personally identifiable information (defined below)."
" That being said, your contact information, such as your phone number, "
"social media handle, or email address (depending on how you contact us), "
"may be collected when you communicate with us, for example to report a "
"bug or other error related to Anastasis. We don’t share your information "

msgid ""
"The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) "

"identify you as an individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-"
"personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be "
"used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy "
"Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and "
"use each type."

msgid ""
"We do our best to not collect any Personal Information from Anastasis "
"users.  The detailed Personal Information Anastasis asks from you during "
"the regular backup and recovery process at the beginning is never shared "
"with us and only used to create a cryptographic account identifier which "
"does not allow us to recover any of your details."

"That being said, when using our Services to recover key material, we may "

"Your phone number when using SMS authentication. We rely on third party "
