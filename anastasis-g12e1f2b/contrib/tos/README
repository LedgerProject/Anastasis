This directory contains the terms of service (template) for exchange
operators.


Dependencies
============

Generating new Terms of Service requires Sphinx, LaTeX with babel
packages for all supported languages.  On Debian, you should
at least install:

$ apt install python3-sphinx sphinx-intl texlive-lang-german texlive-lang-english

(NOTE: List may be incomplete.)


Updating the Terms of Service
=============================

The master file with the Terms of service is 'tos.rst'.

If you make substantial changes, you MUST change the "TOS_VERSION"
in contrib/Makefile.am to the new Etag.

To begin the translation into other languages after editing the master
file, run

$ make gettext

to generate the master PO file. Then, run

$ sphinx-intl update -p _build/locale/ -l de -l fr -l it

to update the PO files for the various languages (extend the list of
languages as necessary). The PO files for the translators are kept
at locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/tos.po for the language $LANG.

Once all PO files have been updated with new translations, run

$ make update-tos

in the "contrib/" directory to generate all of the formats.  The
respective make rule calls the '../update-tos.sh' script in the
contrib/ directory, which calls the 'Makefile' in the tos/
directory for the various supported languages and file formats
and then moves the generated files to the target directory
('contrib/tos/$LANG/$VERSION.$FORMAT')


Adding a new language
=====================

To add a new language $LANG, add $LANG to "TOS_LANGUAGES" in
'contrib/Makefile.am' and run

$ sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l $LANG

to generate the PO template.
