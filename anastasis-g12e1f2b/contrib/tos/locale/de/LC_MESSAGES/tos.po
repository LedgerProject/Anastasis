"highly experimental and the set of recipients of funds is severely "

"your Taler Wallet is loaded with electronic coins they can be spent for "
"purchases if the seller is accepting Taler as a means of payment. We are "
"not guaranteeing that any seller is accepting Taler at all or a "
"particular seller.  The seller or recipient of deposits of electronic "
"coins must specify the target account, as per the design of the Taler "
"protocol. They are responsible for following the protocol and specifying "
"the correct bank account, and are solely liable for any losses that may "
"arise from specifying the wrong account. We will allow the government to "
"link wire transfers to the underlying contract hash. It is the "
"responsibility of recipients to preserve the full contracts and to pay "
"whatever taxes and charges may be applicable. Technical issues may lead "
"to situations where we are unable to make transfers at all or lead to "
"incorrect transfers that cannot be reversed. We will only refuse to "

"wallet should obtain and display applicable fees when withdrawing funds. "
"Fees for coins obtained as change may differ from the fees applicable to "
"the original coin. Wire transfer fees that are independent from "
"electronic coins may change annually.  You authorize us to charge or "
