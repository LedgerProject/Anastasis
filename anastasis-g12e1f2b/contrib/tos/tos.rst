Terms Of Service
================

Last Updated: 07.09.2021

Welcome! Anastasis SARL (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a distributed
privacy-preserving backup and recovery service for key material
through our Internet presence (collectively the “Services”). Before
using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or
the “Agreement”) carefully.

Overview
--------

This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this
Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are
accepting all of the terms and conditions and not just this
section. We and possibly other third parties provide Internet services
which interact with the Anastasis key backup and recovery
application. When using an application to interact with our Services,
you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.


Highlights:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    • You are responsible for selecting authentication methods and
      policies that are adequate to protect your key material.
      Any losses arising from you not being able to satisfy the
      selected authentication challenges or third parties being able
      successfully pass the challenges are your problem.
    • We will store your encrypted key shares and disclose them upon
      successful authentication to the best of our ability within the
      limitations of the law and our implementation. Our liability will
      be limited to the liability limit exposed in the protocol.
    • For our Services, we may charge various fees. The specific fee structure
      is provided based on the Anastasis protocol and should be shown to you when you
      use an application to interact with our services. You agree and understand
      that the Anastasis protocol allows for the fee structure to change.
    • You agree to not intentionally overwhelm our systems with requests and
      follow responsible disclosure if you find security issues in our services.
    • We cannot be held accountable for our Services not being available due to
      circumstances beyond our control. If we modify or terminate our services,
      we will announce this and ensure that you can recover your key material
      for at least one year before we completely terminate the Service.

These terms outline approved uses of our Services. If you have any
questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a
message to legal@anastasis.lu. If you do not agree to this Agreement,
you must not use our Services.


How you accept this policy
--------------------------

By using our API (typically via an Anastasis-enabled application), you
acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these
Terms. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. If you
disagree with the change, you must simply stop using our APIs.  Your
continued use of our Services following any such change will signify
your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check
the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes
since you have last reviewed these Terms.

Services
--------

We will store your encrypted key shares (and the associated encrypted
recovery policy document) to the best of our ability and within the
limitations of the implementation. We will disclose the key shares only
after the specific authentication challenge has been passed. We will
rate-limit the use of the authentication APIs to limit brute-force
attacks.

We are not guaranteeing that the authentication procedures are effective.
Other parties may be able to intercept authentication messages, or you
may not be able to receive these messages anymore. You are responsible
for choosing safe authentication methods with sufficient security.

When using our Services, you agree to not take any action that
intentionally imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure. If
you find security problems in our Services, you agree to first report
them to security@anastasis.lu and grant us the right to publish your
report. We warrant that we will ourselves publicly disclose any issues
reported within 1 month, and that we will not prosecute anyone
reporting security issues if they did not exploit the issue beyond a
proof-of-concept, and followed the above responsible disclosure
practice.


Fees
----

You agree to pay the fees for backup and recovery operations ("Fees")
as defined by us, which we may change from time to time. Your
Anastasis client should obtain and display applicable fees during
backup and recovery.


Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible to use our Services, you must be able to form legally binding
contracts or have the permission of your legal guardian. By using our
Services, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements
that we outline in these Terms.

strict liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or any other legal
theory, and whether or not we were advised of the possibility of such

accessible via the services is accurate, complete, available, current, free of
viruses or other harmful components, or that the results of using the services
will meet your requirements. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of
implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you. This
paragraph gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal
rights that vary from state to state.

courts in Luxembourg for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute
arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of these
Terms.
