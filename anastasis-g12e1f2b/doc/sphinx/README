This repository contains the documentation for all main GNU Taler components.

Before building the documentation, make sure that you have the required
dependencies installed using pip3:

$ pip3 install --user --upgrade recommonmark sphinx

Note by Buck: when setting up on VM, I also needed:

# apt install texlive-latex-extra graphviz
