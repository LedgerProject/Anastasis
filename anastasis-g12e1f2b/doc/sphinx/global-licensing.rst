Anastasis licensing information
===============================

This file gives an overview of all Anastasis component's licensing and
of runtime dependencies thereof. For "component" here is meant a set
of source files which can be retrieved from a single repository.  If
components consist of sources under different licensing regimes, i.e.
because we want to enable third party developments to easily integrate
with Taler, those are described as well.

All Anastasis components are generally released under the Affero
GPL.
